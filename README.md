Random Forest Model
Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our Random Forest Model implementation. This model is a robust ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

Features
Ensemble Learning: Leverages the power of multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and control over-fitting.
Feature Importance Analysis: Gain insights into which features are most influential in predicting the target variable.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Includes scripts for tuning model parameters to achieve the best performance on your dataset.
Cross-Validation: Implements cross-validation to ensure the model’s effectiveness and generalizability.


from random_forest import RandomForestClassifier

# Load your dataset
# X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = ...

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=10)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Customization
Hyperparameters: Customize n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and more to fit the model to your specific dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Implement your own preprocessing pipeline to prepare your data for optimal results.
